E-Currency Coin version 0.2.5.2 now available

This is a new version release, including various bugfixes and
performance improvements.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/greg-griffith/eccoin/issues>

Compatibility
==============

E-Currency Coin is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

E-Currency Coin should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

#### Core reference code upgrade

The core code version that was referenced in the previous wallets was bitcoin core 0.7.X 
and with this release has been updated to closer reflect to bitcoin 0.12.1. This 
comes with many performance improvements and various bug fixes. 


#### PoS algorithm change


The way the wallet determines the hashProofOfStake and checks for a valid stake 
kernel for a PoS block has been radically changed. It has stayed in line with 
the same requirements that the older versions have used for security reasons. 

Known Bugs
==========

There might be an issue for some users with the wallet.dat files requiring a
newer version of E-Currency Coin daemon. This can be fixed by starting the
wallet with forceupgradewallet=1 set in the config file. There might also
be a bug where a users balance does not show all of the coins in their wallet,
this can be fixed by adding zapwallettxes=1 to the config file before starting
the wallet. Neither of the previous config changes should be left in for more than
1 wallet restart.

There is an issue with the wallet.dat thinking it is corrupted due to a bad file in the
database folder. It has been reported that this can be fixed by deleting the database folder
and restarting the wallet. 

0.2.5.2 Change log
=================

Higher restructions prevent PoW blocks from being mined after block 1504000 after someone figured out
how to mine PoW blocks again in July of 2017. 

Core upgrade from bitcoin 0.7.6 to bitcoin 0.12.1

PoS system checking for a valid stake kernel hash completely reworked

Syncing is now done by headers rather than blocks

Other various small bugfixes and improvements
